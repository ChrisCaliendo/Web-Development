            <h3> My Programming Skills </h3>
            <p> 
            I have experience in programming with the following languages:
            </p>
            <h4>Java</h4>
            <p>
                I have taken multiple data structure courses in college to learn
                how write code in Java. I have passed two of these clases as of 
                yet and have a record of completed java programs.
            </p>
            <h4>Python</h4>
            <p>
                While I have yet to write any large scale programs alike to the 
                record I have in java I have experience with the basics of the 
                language.
            </p>
            <h4>GDscript</h4>
            <p>
                As a hobby I try to program games and I typically use the language 
                GDscript to do so. It is very similar to Python so it was simple 
                to get a hang of and I as of date have made multiple projects with
                it.
            </p>
            <h4>SQL</h4>
            <p>
                I have taken a past class on databases in college and as being a 
                database language and utilizing the MySQL program I have learned 
                the basics in creating and managing a standard database using that 
                language.
            </p>
            <h4>HTML</h4>
            <p>
                My only experience in writing in HTML is while in the creation of
                this very webpage. In the past however I was familiar with it while 
                making slight edits to webpages using inspect element in a browser.

            <h3> Interests </h3>
            <p>
                I have many personal interests and hobbies that I like to do in my 
                spare time. First of which as stated before is that I have a passion 
                to get into game development and have attempted and in someways 
                succeeded at making small games for desktop. Another hobby of mine 
                as evident of being in this class is programming. I have made some 
                personal programing projects on the side with the use of Python. 
                An example of such is the development of a discord bot that allows
                you to play games in a discord server chat with others. Another 
                hobby of mine is creating art, while im no professional I like to
                do some art on the side. Even recently Ive learned to create 3d art 
                with the aid of programs such as Blender and have had a lot of fun
                doing so. These are just a few examples of what I like to do for 
                hobbies and fun.
